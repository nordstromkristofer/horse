The project was created as the final assignment for the course "**Advanced web development with JavaScript (Kurs)**" under the "**Frontend developer web security**" education. 

This project involves a Webshop where one can shop for the finest steeds for the mightiest of adventures. We are aiming for the G grade; you can find the final version under the **dbImplantation** branch.

Following is a list of contributors and their contributions:

**Sara Razm (sararazm)** & **Mohammad Arefi (Gogoreds)**: Innitial design, Front-end coding and styling of the project; After the innitial design on **_FIGMA_**, we used **_ReactJS_** and **_TailwindCSS_** to create a visually pleasent design for the users.

**Lilhem Yowhanes (ezelnali) & Kim Garcia Haas (Kgh136)**: Search function and Database implantation; Using **_JavaScript_**, **_ReactJS_** and **_SQLite_**, we have created a functional search box and filtering option for the website.

**Kristofer Nordstr√∂m (nordstromkristofer) & Markus Bellika (Bellika)**: Back-end coding, APIs, camera functions and much more! Using what we learned at the course, we took care of all our users' needs.
